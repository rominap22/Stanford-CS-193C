<!--about myself-->
<p>
	I am currently a rising junior in high school at Basis Independent Silicon Valley in San Jose, California. I live with my parents and my 9-year-old brother in Santa Clara, California. I have been passionate about computer science since I was ten years old, and I have been consistently attending classes and programs that will further that passion of mine. I went to Challenger School until 6th grade and then went to Basis Independent Silicon Valley from 7th grade(will be graduating in 2020).
</p>
<p>
	Since age ten, I have taken computer programming courses in Java, HTML, and Python. I took a foundation computer programming class in 8th grade and passed the AP Computer Science A exam last year as a freshman. I also attended the ID Tech Programming and Engineering Academy from the past four years and have consistently earned CEUs(Continuing Education Units) granted by Villanova University. The languages I learned were HTML, XML, PHP, JQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and Python. Throughout my experiences in programming, I have demonstrated a keen interest in computer engineering. I previously took an ID Tech computer science course at <span><b>Stanford</b></span> for two weeks that was mobile app development using Java in Android Studio. Just before that course, I attended a high school girls hackathon in Foster City for which I was the campus ambassador, where I teamed up with two of her classmates and helped code a fully functional iOS application in under 12 hours. For two years now, I have been a campus ambassador for the SUperposition hackathon, which is the largest all-girls hackathon in the Bay Area. This year, I was fortunate enough to be the Director of Outreach for the upcoming hackathon. Earlier this year, I also was recognized at the regional level for the NCWIT award for aspirations in computing.

	In freshman year, I started a club for fifth through seventh graders called Code Cats and continues to run this club. This club teaches children the essentials of programming using Python, HTML, and CSS. By starting this club, I am not only allowing these young innovators to learn a new language that sets a strong foundation for their future programming pursuits, but also training them to thrive in the technologically-driven world we live in today. This summer, I am attending a six-week intensive college program at <span><b>Stanford</b></span>. She plans on taking a course in programming methodologies that will enhance her proficiency in Java and software engineering as well as client-side internet technologies. In the future, I would like to major in computer engineering by utilizing the computing technology available to create meaningful and useful programs that are worth sharing with the community. I also aspire to participate in statewide, national, and worldwide hackathons to improve upon my abilities to think as critically as a programmer and a developer. My most desirable aspiration, however, would be to spread my knowledge in computing and technology to those that do not readily have education or experience with such technologies and help people make their voice heard.
